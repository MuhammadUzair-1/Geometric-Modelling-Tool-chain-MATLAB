 Core Purpose
This MATLAB-based Propeller Analysis Toolchain is a comprehensive reverse engineering solution that transforms raw 3D scan data of propellers into precise engineering measurements, CAD models, and detailed analysis reports.

Key Capabilities

1. 3D Scan Processing
Takes: Raw, noisy point cloud data from 3D scanners (PLY, PCD, XYZ formats)

Does: Cleans, filters, and optimizes the data for analysis

Outputs: High-quality, processed point cloud ready for feature extraction

2. Automated Geometry Recognition
Identifies: Hub, blades, and other components automatically

Separates: Different parts of the propeller using advanced segmentation algorithms

Outputs: Individual point clouds for each propeller component

3. Precision Alignment
Determines: Optimal coordinate system based on propeller geometry

Aligns: Propeller to standard engineering reference frame (Z-axis = rotation axis)

Outputs: Perfectly oriented geometry for consistent measurements

4. Feature Extraction
Extracts: Blade centerline (the "spine" of each blade)

Creates: Cross-sectional slices at regular intervals along blades

Outputs: Systematic sampling of blade geometry at multiple stations

5. Mathematical Modeling
Fits: Accurate B-spline curves to each cross-section

Creates: NURBS surfaces that perfectly represent blade geometry

Outputs: Mathematical representations suitable for CAD and analysis

6. Engineering Analysis
Calculates: Chord length at each blade station

Measures: Blade pitch (progression along rotation axis)

Quantifies: Twist distribution along blade span

Outputs: Comprehensive geometric parameter database

7. CAD & Report Generation
Exports: Industry-standard IGES files for CAD systems

Generates: STL files for 3D printing and visualization

Creates: Detailed JSON reports with all measurements

Produces: Professional visualizations and plots
